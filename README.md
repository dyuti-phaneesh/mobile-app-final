# ✨ Mobile App Final Project ✨

## Meet The Team!! 👩‍💻👩‍💻👩‍💻

Introducing Dyuti Phaneesh, Yashika Kathuria, and Dikshi Shanmugaraja, a triple threat team of wit, humour, and amazingness :D \
Our collective poor vision just exemplifies our dedication to computer science 🤓

## Our Project Idea 💡

As fans of all things puzzle and logic, we decided to create a sudoku generator / online game for our final! \
Some features we hope to have implemented include: 

* A how-to instruction page for new players
* Three game modes: easy, medium, and hard
* A timer or perhaps even a speed round session
    * This involves keeping track of high scores / fastest time completed!
* Keeping track of wrong answers

If we wanted to kick things up a notch, perhaps having an undo button as well as offering hints could make our game more fun. At the end of the day, we want
the user to enjoy playing our app, so much so that they end up playing more than once! 

## What Will This Look Like? 🤔

For now, we'll have 4 different pages: 

1. Home Screen
2. Instructions / How-To Page
3. Game / Sudoku Board
4. Scoresheet

A basic outline will look something like this: 

``` mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Home Screen] --> B[How To]
A --> C[New Game]
A --> D[Scoreboard]
B --> oE[Instruction page on basic rules to game; maybe link to external source]
C --> oF[Have buttons for easy, medium, and hard modes]
D --> oG[A scrollable tracker that keeps info after switching pages]
```

...with everything connecting back to the home screen!
